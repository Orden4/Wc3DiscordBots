# Wc3DiscordBots
This repository is for hosting the codebases of Discord bots that I've created for Warcraft 3.

### JassBot
JassBot is the Discord version of the [JassBot site](https://lep.duckdns.org/jassbot/), powered by the info that is publicly available via the [JassDoc repository](https://github.com/lep/jassdoc).  
[Click here to invite the bot to your Discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1390373640658223234&permissions=2048&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)

### HostBot
A bot that will announce/track lobbies for maps of your choosing.

Not yet publicly available, but already online on Lord Damage's Mapping Discord.  
Please open an issue to bug me for getting it ready for a public release if you're particularly interested.
